# Personalized News Aggregator App - Design Thinking Case Study

## Project Overview
This project applies the Design Thinking methodology to redesign a news aggregator app with personalized content based on user interests, reading habits, and engagement history.

## Design Thinking Process

### 1. Empathize
- User surveys and feedback analysis
- Understanding user pain points with generic content
- Identifying reading patterns and preferences

### 2. Define
- Problem: Generic content fails to engage users
- Root causes: Lack of personalization, no preference tracking, irrelevant articles

### 3. Ideate
- Personalized news feed algorithm
- User preference management
- Article recommendations
- Content filters
- Topic tracking

### 4. Prototype
- Interactive web-based prototype
- Personalized feed interface
- Preference settings panel
- Recommendation system
- Filter and search functionality

### 5. Test
- User engagement metrics
- A/B testing framework
- Feedback collection system

## Features

### Core Features
- **Personalized Feed**: Articles ranked by user interests and reading history
- **Preference Settings**: Easy-to-use interface for managing interests
- **Recommendations**: AI-powered article suggestions
- **Content Filters**: Filter by topic, source, date, reading time
- **Topic Tracking**: Follow specific topics and get updates

### Personalization Engine
- Tracks reading history and engagement
- Learns from user interactions (clicks, time spent, shares)
- Adjusts feed based on preferences
- Provides topic-based recommendations

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Explore the personalized news feed
3. Adjust preferences in the settings panel
4. Test the recommendation system
