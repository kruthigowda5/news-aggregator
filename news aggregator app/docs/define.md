# Phase 2: Define

## Problem Statement

**Primary Problem**: 
The news aggregator app offers generic content that fails to engage users, resulting in low retention rates and poor user satisfaction.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Current Content Fails to Engage

1. **Lack of Personalization**
   - All users see the same generic feed
   - No consideration of individual interests
   - One-size-fits-all approach

2. **No User Preference System**
   - Users cannot specify interests
   - No way to filter unwanted content
   - Preferences not saved or remembered

3. **No Learning Mechanism**
   - App doesn't track reading behavior
   - Engagement history is ignored
   - No adaptation to user patterns

4. **Poor Content Discovery**
   - Difficult to find relevant articles
   - No recommendation system
   - Topics not organized or tracked

5. **Limited User Control**
   - Cannot customize feed
   - No topic following feature
   - Settings are hard to access

## Problem Framing

### How Might We...
- **HMW** create a personalized experience for each user?
- **HMW** learn from user behavior to improve recommendations?
- **HMW** make preference management intuitive and accessible?
- **HMW** help users discover relevant content quickly?
- **HMW** give users control over their news consumption?
